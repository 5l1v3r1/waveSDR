# waveSDR

A macOS native desktop Software Defined Radio application using the RTL-SDR USB device.

**NB**:  This is purely experimental software.  I am using this application as a platform for teaching myself macOS desktop application programming as well as DSP techniques.  As it is, there are numerous sections of code where improvement is needed.

Features:

* RTL-SDR hardware
* Spectrum Analyzer
* Spectrogram
* AM Demodulator
* FM Narrow Demodulator
* FM Wide Demodulator (mono only)
