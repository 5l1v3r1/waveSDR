Not much happening on waveSDR the last few weeks.  Most of the commits have been simple changes, clean-ups, and trying different things.

Most of my dev time has been spent on my new project [RTLSDR.Swift](https://github.com/getoffmyhack/RTLSDR.Swift) where I am porting librtlsdr to a native Swift / IOKit framework.

Work on RTLSDR.Swift has been progressing without too much difficulty, so go check out that project for more details and to keep track of my adventures in the land of USB and IOKit.

Once I am at a bare minimum of the functionality needed to support waveSDR, I will migrate RTLSDR.Swift into waveSDR and remove librtlsdr.
